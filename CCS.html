The omnibus date is January 13, 2023. Pre-trial conference is set for January 13, 2023, at 9:00 am at which time the defendant and counsel for the parties are ORDERED and DIRECTED to appear. 1. DISCOVERY. Discovery shall be completed as provided by Local Criminal Rule LR08-CR00-18 on or before the fifteenth day prior to the trial date. 2. PRE-OMNIBUS MEETING OF ATTORNEYS. Trial counsel for the defense and State shall meet prior to the omnibus hearing; in the absence of agreement as to the time and place of meeting, they shall meet at a place designated by the State and shall undertake and consider the following: A. They shall complete the Omnibus Report which shall then be filed with the Court prior to the omnibus hearing. B. They shall exchange lists of the names and addresses of witnesses and exhibits. C. They shall discuss simplifications of the issues, motions then pending or which may be filed before the commencement of trial, stipulations, theories of prosecution and defense, and plea negotiations, if any. 3. OMNIBUS HEARING. All cases scheduled for trial on the date set in this order will be scheduled for Omnibus Hearing at the same time. The Court will first determine if the parties contemplate the entry of a plea of guilty by the defendant, either with or without a plea agreement. If there is to be a plea of guilty, the plea will be entered following any other scheduled Omnibus Hearings. The court will not accept a plea agreement after the Omnibus Hearing without a showing of good cause why the plea agreement could not have been reached at or prior to the Omnibus Hearing. If no plea of guilty is entered, the Court will determine whether any cases with an earlier filing date or cases which the Court has assigned a higher priority remain scheduled for the same trial date. If there are none, then the trial date will stand, otherwise, a new trial date will be set. 4. WITNESSES AND EXHIBIT. Lists of witnesses and exhibits in writing shall be prepared, exchanged, and filed with the Court at the omnibus hearing. 5. JURY INSTRUCTIONS. Preliminary and final instructions shall be tendered to the Court and exchanged by the parties no later than three court days prior to the trial. The Court will permit the tender of additional instructions during the trial on matters which could not reasonably have been anticipated in advance of trial. Counsel shall not refer to or read any proposed instructions to the jury in voir dire examination, opening statement, or otherwise, unless such instruction has been previously submitted to and approved by the Court.

Code &sect; 5-14-3-5.5 and Indiana Rules of Court, Rules on Access to Court Records, Rule 6, November 22, 2022 at 9:00 a.m. in the Carroll Circuit Court. Parties or members of the general public will be permitted to testify and submit written briefs, subject to reasonable time constraints imposed by the Court. A decision to seal all or part of a public record must be based on findings of fact and conclusions of law, showing that the remedial benefits to be gained by effectuating the public policy of the state declared in section 1 of this chapter are outweighed by proof by a preponderance of the evidence by the person seeking the sealing of the record that: 1) A public interest will be secured by sealing the record; 2) Dissemination of the information contained in the record will create a serious and imminent danger to that public interest; 3) Any prejudicial effect created by dissemination of the information cannot be avoided by any reasonable method other than sealing the record; 4) There is a substantial probability that sealing the record will be effective in protecting the public interest against the perceived danger; and 5) It is reasonably necessary for the record to remain sealed for a period of time. Sealed records shall be unsealed at the earliest possible time after the circumstances necessitating the sealing of the records no longer exist. SO ORDERED this 2nd day of November, 2022.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Sheriff Tobe Leazenby files a </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SSk1nOPN8Y0ckc_hVAq4GlXaZ07Yslkp/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787144068&amp;usg=AOvVaw2yoyQkFX4U0OJ2VhNzjv2Z">Request by the Sheriff of Carroll County, Indiana to Transfer Inmate from the Custody of the Sheriff to the Custody of the Indiana Department of Corrections for Safekeeping</a></span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on November 2, 2022.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Judge Diener enters bizarre, rambling </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZSR1vDnnWPOx8ll3otDfPBRAus0mEiDJ/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787144356&amp;usg=AOvVaw1ZeKOFe5gMd-M89fLDjn_3">Safekeeping Order</a></span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on November 3, 2022.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3 c9">On November 2, 2022, Tobe H. Leazenby, Sheriff of Carroll County, filed a Request by the Sheriff of Carroll County to Transfer inmate from Carroll County Jail to the Custody of the Indiana Department of Corrections for Safekeeping. The Court, being duly advised, FINDS that Defendant is an inmate awaiting trial and is in imminent danger of serious bodily injury or death, or represents a substantial threat to the safety of others. This FINDING is not predicated on any acts or alleged acts of the Defendant, since arrest, rather a toxic and harmful insistence on &quot;public information&quot; about Defendant and this case. In general, this Court has thirty (30) days to rule on any Motion that is filed by a Party in any case. See Ind. Trial Rule 53.1 (A). Yet, concurrent to the actual case naturally occurring, this judicial officer keeps getting direct requests from non-parties for &quot;public information,&quot; claiming that this officer has seven (7) days or one (1) day, when hand delivered, to respond to the request or face litigation! While this officer is responsible for the entirety of the Circuit Court docket it attempts to ignore the maelstrom of &quot;interest&quot; from the public, it is known that YouTube already hosts content regarding family members of this judicial officer, including photos. The public&#39;s blood lust for information, before it exists, is extremely dangerous. ALL PUBLIC SERVANTS administering this action do not feel safe and are not protected. The Carroll County Sheriff has limited resources to conduct its base operations, let alone any duties mandated by our Supreme Court. All Defendants in all actions are presumed innocent. All public information will be available the second it exists. None of the family members of public servants are part of this action. All of the public servants are simply people doing their jobs. Most of the public servants are woefully underpaid. Most of the &quot;public interest&quot; consists of people attempting to raise their status or profit financially. When the public peddles misinformation with reckless abandon, we all are not safe. As far as the public&#39;s desire to learn about access to court records, that educational effort cannot be by this officer educating each individual, ad-hoc, whenever they choose to seek &quot;public information.&quot; These inquiries are inherently disruptive to the operations of the Court as they are wholly outside the operations of the Court. As a branch of the Supreme Court, any requests for public information about this action should be directed to whomever is the public information coordinator for the Courts in general. If there is not such a position, our state may need one. Defendant indicated at the initial hearing an intention to hire private counsel. Defendant is reminded that he must retain counsel within 20 days of the initial hearing because there are deadlines for filing motions and raising defenses and, if those deadlines are missed, the legal issues and defenses that could have been raised will be waived or given up. If Defendant is unable to retain counsel of his choosing due to financial indigency, Defendant is reminded that he is entitled to court-appointed counsel and Defendant will be examined upon request. The Court notes, for the public, that when Defendant appeared for the initial hearing, he was clad in protective gear. That protection was not to protect Defendant from the Court. That protection was to protect Defendant from the public. Until a finding of guilt or a judgment of conviction occurs, in any case, judgment must be reserved and the presumption of innocence must be respected and preserved. Accordingly, pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 35-33-11-1, the Court ORDERS the Sheriff of Carroll County to transfer Defendant to a facility of the department of correction designated by the commissioner of the department as suitable for the confinement of Defendant and provided that space is available. So ORDERED this 3rd day of November, 2022.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Judge Diener enters an </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TzYsvD8wMiJ5OQslzRuCRsbSOsdmbo-s/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787145071&amp;usg=AOvVaw0O3GRpT22TaN5QhyuDlTBV">Order of Recusal and Certification to the Indiana Supreme Court for Selection of a Special Judge Outside of Carroll County</a></span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on November 3, 2022.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3 c9">The Judge of Carroll Circuit Court has determined that the particular circumstances within the underlying case warrant recusal and dictate that a special judge be appointed in this case.

Counsel agree with the Court that the public interest is best served by transparency, but that certain pleadings should remain sealed. Counsel agree that the original, unredacted Affidavit for Probable Cause shall remain sealed as it lists names of juvenile witnesses; that the Transport Orders previously entered (and future Orders) shall remain sealed for security purposes; and that the Defense Ex Parte Motions and related Orders shall remain sealed pursuant to long established case law. All other pleadings filed prior to the date of this Order shall be unsealed and available to the public, except for the pleadings explicitly mentioned in this paragraph. Future pleadings and filings that are to be confidential shall comply with Court rules. Further, the Court has consulted with the Clerk of the Carroll Circuit Court about the impact of this Order on her office and staff, and the public interest in the pleadings which are being made available. As hundreds of pages of documents are being unsealed, this may create obstacles to the Clerk and the public. To ease the burden on the Clerk of the Court, and to ensure accessibility, the Clerk of the Court, and to ensure accessibility, the Court will make copies of the now public pleadings available at allensuperiorcourt.us/Delphi.John McGauley, Allen Superior Court, Court Executive has created this page on the Court&#39;s website to make these pleadings easily accessible to the public, the media, and the parties.

The Court Order states that the Court &quot;FINDS that Defendant is an inmate awaiting trial and is in imminent danger of serious bodily injury or death, or represents a substantial threat to the safety of others.&quot; The evidence presented at the hearing on defendant&#39;s Motion to Reconsider did not support many of the allegations advanced by defendant counsel. In fact, the evidence presented demonstrated that the Defendant is treated more favorably than other inmates housed at the Westville Correctional Facility. In light of the evidence presented, the Court has reconsidered the original Safekeeping Order and finds it is reasonable and necessary to ensure the defendant&#39;s safety and to prevent serious bodily injury to himself. The Department of Correction has provided, and will continue to provide Defendant with the necessarily medical services, including any mental health services. If the Department of Correction believes a facility other than Westville is more appropriate, or more convenient for Counsel, the Court is confident that the Department of Correction will move the defendant accordingly.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c10 c5"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_ivtM8F0Jf-KUJ0XNxh3tRdA-lEMmfE0&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787196960&amp;usg=AOvVaw0HfeSXht3q3zjjI8zTofx1">AUGUST 2023</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Brad Rozzi files a </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/19PgCChVcvfrJ79LhLCAsZoxWkFBT0DKJ/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787197294&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Cmp7uux1ceooQqoT3shSh">Praecipe for Transcript</a></span><span class="c4 c3">;

Pursuant to the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 2.17, a judge shall prohibit broadcasting, televising, recording, or taking photographs in the Courtroom. However, a judge may authorize the broadcasting, televising, recording, digital streaming, or photographing of court proceedings or the Courtroom by members of the news media under certain conditions. (Rule 2.17(3)(a)(b)). News media is defined as persons employed by or representing a newspaper, periodical, press association, radio station, television station, or wire service and covered by I.C. 34-46-4-1. All of the submitted requests meet this definition. Counsel for the State and the defense have been provided with these requests, and both have previously submitted pleadings stating their positions on cameras in the Courtroom. (See defense Motion for Broadcasting Order, filed September 13, 2023, and State&#39;s Response to Defendant&#39;s Motion for Broadcasting Order, filed September 25, 2023). The Court has determined that allowing recording of the October 19, 2023, hearing is permitted provided that the means of recording will not distract the participants or impair the dignity of the proceedings, and the hearing itself is a non-confidential proceeding. The Court, therefore, authorizes the recording and broadcasting of the hearing set for October 19, 2023. The Court WILL NOT permit photographing or digital streaming of the proceedings. All news media will be required to wear/display identification and to wear appropriate attire. One or two cameras will be authorized for pool coverage of the hearing. Members of the general public are prohibited from broadcasting, recording, or photographing this proceeding. The Court will prohibit media broadcast during this hearing of attorney-client communications, bench conferences, and materials on counsel tables and the Court&#39;s bench.

Defendant&#39;s Motion for Broadcasting Order is overbroad. The Court will consider broadcast requests by the media (after notice to the Defense and the State) on a hearing-by-hearing basis. Therefore, the Motion for Broadcasting Order is denied. 2. Defendant&#39;s Motion to Quash Subpoenas (requested by the State for defendant&#39;s medical and mental health records) is granted as the State is not entitled to such records. 3. Defendant&#39;s Verified Motion for Immediate Transfer of Custody is denied based upon the State&#39;s Response and attached Affidavits. The Defense multiple Motions for a Franks Hearing remain unresolved as the Court is still reviewing the thousands of pages of exhibits attached to the Motions, as well as the multiple hours of digital evidence submitted by counsel. The Court will continue to review same. Defendant&#39;s Motion to Suppress and Supplemental Motions to Suppress, as well as the State&#39;s Responses, will be set for hearing upon resolution of the defense Franks Motions. Prior to the scheduled hearing this date, Attorneys Rozzi and Baldwin advise the Court they will be withdrawing their representation of the defendant. Court accepts their representations and orders them withdrawn from the cause. Counsel ordered to comply with the previously entered Protective Order on Discovery and are ordered to turn the discovery over in full to the State of Indiana to be made available to successor counsel. Court requests their cooperation with successor counsel in the best interests of their former client, but is not requiring them to cooperate. Court will maintain the hearing currently scheduled for October 31, 2023, at 9:00 a.m. in the Carroll Circuit Court for successor counsel to appear. Clerk of the Carroll Circuit Court ordered to remove Attorneys Baldwin and Rozzi as attorneys of record in this cause.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5 c12">Hearing Scheduling Activity</span><span class="c3 c12">; dated</span><span class="c5 c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c14 c3 c12">on October 23, 2023.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14 c3 c12 c9">Hearing scheduled for 10/31/2023 at 9:00 am.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c3 c12"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3 c12">Judge Gull enters a </span><span class="c5 c12">Transport Order</span><span class="c3 c12">; </span><span class="c4 c3">dated on October 24, 2023.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3 c12">Brad Rozzi files a </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1awFI1T0Rh7nPlKvNY109InDALPm4mmMN/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787211902&amp;usg=AOvVaw3CHUMAnoWJAOt5nU0Ey-R8">Verified Notice of Continuing Representation</a></span><span class="c14 c3 c12">; dated on October 25, 2023.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c3 c12"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3 c12">Brad Rozzi files a </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jZ70iFC-SCo1t7Jw5jlttqweIAnusQD8/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787212217&amp;usg=AOvVaw0CmyAFufOhMam2OMx8I2CR">Praecipe for Transcript</a></span><span class="c14 c3 c12">; dated on October 25, 2023.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c3 c12"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3 c12">Brad Rozzi files a </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kgwu__dcSgoYmvzd3AqlAvAC1uzlaCMI/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787212528&amp;usg=AOvVaw2VkvSRLvKOw0zCoMHn5-ht">Motion To Disqualify</a></span><span class="c3 c12">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IF7P5Db1zP-pbHwlYxg_cMgFiSihOBsd&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787212738&amp;usg=AOvVaw2TecI6R45fCltwzYjse38V">Exhibits</a></span><span class="c14 c3 c12">; dated on October 25, 2023.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c3 c12"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3 c12">Brad Rozzi files a </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mFrLw3iNtQqpvTudd5JFxCxPGqnq1fte/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787213029&amp;usg=AOvVaw3G3Cc7wDjUshoDAA7jzBmn">Motion For Continuance</a></span><span class="c14 c3 c12">; dated on October 26, 2023.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c3 c12"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3 c12">David Hennessy files a </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XoOMtYHtGzU-pOlq4U5NHinHqCtzixKOOHAMBVc6bb8&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787213346&amp;usg=AOvVaw1GX9eCKXd7XvZ4SCE-1lDm">Motion to Reconsider</a></span><span class="c14 c3 c12">; dated on October 27, 2023.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c3 c12"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3 c12">David Hennessy files a </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/18WMDJz7LVCBUoqP6D4trr5WpcJir4LO5/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787213631&amp;usg=AOvVaw19mLg_IJ2LzYW_tGFkn5Af">Praecipe</a></span><span class="c14 c3 c12">; dated on October 27, 2023.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c3 c12"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3 c12">Judge Gull enters an </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aJ3Fl1a8nT0bVVxH-G1NeSwHmLDwoAbQ/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787213920&amp;usg=AOvVaw3F7Z3Bmcboz-74XxltOLyH">Order</a></span><span class="c3">; </span><span class="c14 c3 c12">dated on October 27, 2023.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14 c3 c12 c9">Court notes filings by former Attorney Rozzi on October 25, 2023, and takes no action.

State by Prosecuting Attorney Nicholas McLeland and Special Prosecutor James Luttrell. Former counsel Rozzi and Baldwin also appear, having entered an appearance October 30, 2023. Attorney Scremin and Lebrato&#39;s Motion to Continue the jury trial heard and granted without objection by the State as defendant is accepting the Criminal Rule 4 time. Court then addresses former attorneys Baldwin and Rozzi&#39;s appearance. The Court previously found gross negligence by said attorneys in their representation of the defendant. Nothing has changed in the intervening twelve (12) days that removes the Court&#39;s grave concerns about their representation. Over Rozzi and Baldwin&#39;s strenuous objections, Court disqualifies them from representing the defendant and affirms the appointment of contract Public Defenders Scremin and Lebrato. Former attorneys represent to the Court they will return all discovery to the State of Indiana by the end of the week. Counsel ordered to do so to enable the State to provide that discovery to Attorneys Scremin and Lebrato. Court encourages former attorneys to cooperate with Attorneys Scremin and Lebrato for the benefit of the defendant. Court notes two (2) pending motions (Motion to Suppress, Motion for Franks Hearing) and will await a report from Attorneys Scremin and Lebrato and Prosecuting Attorney McLeland regarding hearing dates. Baldwin&#39;s attorney, Hennessey, addresses the Court at Baldwin&#39;s request. Jury trial scheduled for October 15 - November 1, 2024, with jury selection to be conducted in Allen County and trial in Carroll County.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Cara Wieneke files a </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z1oHx2HIg4A36mQc9k3vbRKQFPO-JkmT/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787222859&amp;usg=AOvVaw1oDVYF_7BUXB8IUZe6WURq">Limited Appearance</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;For The Purpose of Requesting Transcripts </span><span class="c5 c30">for Case No. 23S-OR-00302</span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on November 2, 2023.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Cara Wieneke files </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z77Mu-UheBHESxz6YsTer9O5tg7PvSY4/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787223202&amp;usg=AOvVaw3XUpy760biQqEODl_L1D9D">Defendant&rsquo;s Motion for Transcripts for </a></span><span class="c11 c5"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z77Mu-UheBHESxz6YsTer9O5tg7PvSY4/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787223386&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ZtX2-iN-bEtbQQkf-qRdW">Case No. 23S-OR-00302</a></span><span class="c3">; </span><span class="c4 c3">dated on November 2, 2023.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Matthew Gutwein and Christopher Stake enter their </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CDuKj4trgtG--1qJ5hJit-EgkKxXBba4/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787223742&amp;usg=AOvVaw0_uz46rmA9gpqMqwVrE_Bi">Appearance</a></span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on November 3, 2023.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Matthew Gutwein and Christopher Stake file an </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ciW8TF3rgauZbHpO1EiDTNKt3SK4AAcg/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787224101&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ocjwJ1Cq6pNsS1SMlrQRC">Unopposed Motion for Extension of Time to Respond to Petition for Writs of Mandamus and Prohibition for </a></span><span class="c11 c5"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ciW8TF3rgauZbHpO1EiDTNKt3SK4AAcg/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787224289&amp;usg=AOvVaw2hSqC_PEoo9g-otLmH5Lbk">Case No. 23S-OR-00302</a></span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on November 3, 2023.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Loretta H.

Being duly advised, the Court ORDERS Respondents to either file a response to Relator&#39;s &quot;Motion for Transcript&quot; with the Clerk of this Court on or before Thursday, November 16, 2023, or to include the requested transcript as a supplemental record filed pursuant to Original Action Rules 3(C) and (G) and this Court&#39;s order of November 6, 2023.

The Court previously created a website for these documents as a convenience to the public and the Clerk and to ensure the public had prompt remote access to these documents. The Clerk is ordered to enter these documents on the CCS forthwith. The Clerk is further ordered to unseal the June 20, 2023, filing by the Carroll County Sheriff and the July 5, 2023, letter from a Department of Correction inmate and place same on the CCS. The Court further notes that a Motion for Franks Hearing, and accompanying documents filed by former attorneys on September 18, 2023 (including the Franks Motion, Memorandum in Support of Motion and Exhibits List) are marked as confidential on the CCS as counsel failed to supply a redacted version at the time of filing. On October 31, 2023, the Court ordered defendant&#39;s new counsel to review the pleadings and discovery and either adopt those pleadings or make their own. If counsel adopts same, they are ordered to file a redacted version of the pleadings. If defendant&#39;s new counsel inform the Court they intend to pursue the Franks Motion, the Court will schedule a hearing. Finally, the Clerk is ordered to place and make accessible on the CCS former attorneys&#39; pleadings of October 25, 2023, and October 26, 2023. As noted in its prior order, the Court considers these pleadings stricken from the record and will not consider those pleadings as the attorneys who filed same are no longer counsel of record.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Indiana Media Coalition files a </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VUfrl1MybLWXEPBngaQ7bLMePFLG4nQU/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787230687&amp;usg=AOvVaw2w2vYO3bap08igONON4DOM">Motion For Leave To Appear As Amici Curiae for </a></span><span class="c11 c5"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VUfrl1MybLWXEPBngaQ7bLMePFLG4nQU/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787230869&amp;usg=AOvVaw2fWT_PKZpxdSAT9Hxp8OBH">Case No. 23S-OR-00302</a></span><span class="c3">; dated on November 16, 2023.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Chief Counsel of Appeals, Angela N.

He requests that we (1) order the trial court to reinstate several court records as publicly accessible documents on the Chronological Case Summary (&quot;CCS&quot;) and the electronic case file, (2) prohibit the trial court from ordering the removal of any court records filed in this case from the CCS and the electronic case file, and (3) prohibit the trial court from excluding from public access any court records without complying with the requirements of our Rules on Access to Court Records (&quot;A.C.R. Rules&quot;). Allen argues our intervention is necessary because the trial court has failed to perform the clear, absolute duty imposed by our rules to ensure public access to court records. We first explain why Allen has failed to show that our intervention is warranted. And we then provide guidance about the requirements in our A.C.R. Rules. Original actions are viewed with disfavor and may not be used as substitutes for appeals. Ind. Original Action Rule 1(C). Because a writ is an extraordinary remedy, we will not issue a writ unless the party seeking relief &quot;can show a clear and obvious emergency where the failure of this Court to act will result in substantial injustice.&quot; State ex rel. City of New Haven v. Allen Super. Ct., 699 N.E.2d 1134, 1136 (Ind. 1998). Allen has not made the requisite showing here. The requests that prompted this petition have largely been resolved, and thus mooted, by the trial court&#39;s order entered on November 14, 2023. This order directed the trial clerk to take specific actions: (1) placing on the CCS 118 individual documents that were previously made remotely accessible by court order in June 2023; (2) unsealing two filings from June and July 2023 and placing them on the CCS; and (3) placing pleadings that Allen&#39;s former counsel filed in October 2023 on the CCS and making them accessible to the public. Along with reinstating these excluded documents to the CCS, the November 14 order reflects the court&#39;s intention to comply with the A.C.R. Rules going forward. If there are any remaining concerns about access to court records here, interested parties should first seek relief in the trial court and then pursue an appeal if necessary. We now take this opportunity to clarify the requirements in our A.C.R. Rules, which recognize the &quot;strong societal reasons for allowing public access to court records.&quot; Ind. Access to Court Records Rule 1, Commentary. The A.C.R. Rules presume the public will have open access to court records with limited exceptions. Those exceptions are found in Rule 5, which identifies two types of records that are excluded from public access. First, Rule 5(A) sets out several categories of entire cases excluded from public access, including when either statute or court rule requires the records to be treated as confidential. For these records, exclusion from public access is automatic, and no other notice is required. Second, Rule 5(B) sets out thirteen types of individual case records excluded from public access. For records falling under this rule, documents must be filed as confidential and include an &quot;ACR Form&quot; identifying the specific basis for exclusion. Aside from these two exceptions, Rule 6 permits a trial court to exclude otherwise public court records from public access only in extraordinary circumstances and by following the rule&#39;s process. That process requires any person affected by the release of the court record to make a written request to prohibit public access, which must give notice to the parties and allow them twenty days to respond. And before a trial court excludes the requested record, it must hold a public hearing and issue a written order explaining why it is granting the request. A.C.R. Rules 6(C) (D). We expect all Indiana courts to comply with these rules. The Justices of this Court have reviewed the briefs and other filed materials and conferred with each other. Because Allen bore the burden to persuade this Court to issue a writ and he has not done so, the petition is DENIED. This disposition is final. No petitions for rehearing or motions to reconsider shall be filed in this original action. See Orig. Act. R. 5(C). Done at Indianapolis, Indiana, on 12/11/2023. All Justices concur.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">letter from Robert Baston to the Court</span><span class="c4 c3">; filed on December 12, 2023.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c10 c5"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_sBYDiYE_PCQZM4LnupjUgTytFfgRCtR&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787240153&amp;usg=AOvVaw2AafQISryjrldpUQiwFFNo">JANUARY 2024</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Judge Gull enters an </span><span class="c5">Order</span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on January 2, 2024.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Correspondence from Inmate Robert Baston received and reviewed.

Relator has requested a permanent writ of mandamus asking this Court to: (1) order the trial court to reinstate his former trial counsel, attorneys Andrew Baldwin and Brad Rozzi, as his court-appointed counsel; (2) order the trial court to commence Relator&#39;s trial within 70 days from the issuance of the writ; and (3) remove the special judge from Relator&#39;s case and appoint a new special judge. Having considered the written submissions and having heard the arguments of counsel, a majority of the Court votes to GRANT the petition for writ as to Relator&#39;s request to reinstate attorneys Baldwin and Rozzi as his court-appointed counsel. The Court unanimously DENIES all other relief sought. The Court will promptly issue a written opinion explaining its reasons. The pendency of this matter in this Court does not stay the proceedings in the trial court.

The Court finds the Affidavit submitted in support of the issuance of the search warrant contained information that a reasonable belief existed that evidence of the murders would be found in the defendant&#39;s home and vehicles. The Court does not find that the Affidavit submitted false statements or that the Affiant omitted statements with reckless disregard, nor does the Court find that the Affiant intended to mislead the Judge by failing to present information. As the Court has found the Affidavit for issuance of the search warrant was valid, the search itself was reasonable and legal under Indiana law and Fourth Amendment case law. Defendant&#39;s Motion to Suppress Fruits of Search of 1967 North Whiteman Drive, Delphi, IN (filed May 19, 2023) is also denied based upon all the pleadings, memorandums, and exhibits previously submitted in support of the request for a Franks hearing. Defendant&#39;s Motion in Limine Regarding Ballistics (filed June 13, 2023) is reviewed and denied without hearing. The Court finds the evidence contained in Defendant&#39;s Exhibits A and B attached to the Motion is relevant and admissible. The Court further finds the probative value of such evidence is not substantially outweighed by its prejudicial impact, and that the evidence will not confuse or mislead the jury. Defendant&#39;s Motion to Transfer (filed January 12, 2024) taken under advisement pending the State&#39;s response, if any, and a hearing to be set. State&#39;s Motion to Amend Information (filed January 18, 2024) will be set for a remote hearing.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">William Lebrato files his </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-LrmTEdBK3o4BeJfmGi40yb5Y6vp06mb/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787245616&amp;usg=AOvVaw0aBV7Nh6zKio2mTjM1WX8f">Motion to Withdraw Appearance</a></span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on January 24, 2024.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Robert Scremin files his </span><span class="c5">Motion to Withdraw Appearance</span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on January 24, 2024.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Nick McLeland files the </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SC_3YLb76em5Nt0YB_p-gaKueXN-qNEe/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787246073&amp;usg=AOvVaw0BItrinkELXvGcRSRSxUSW">State&rsquo;s Motion to Compel Discovery</a></span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;while sitting on mountains of exculpatory discovery; dated on January 27, 2024.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Andrew Baldwin files the </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/15RIorCCgR67L0w5XWMtAGhjASVDu7rjG/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787246394&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ZlOC3g7MZo0wKjkMB2-cv">Affidavit of Richard Allen</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oZzRiAliOq6GB3j6eh5oGkLDJqPJOpD8/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787246627&amp;usg=AOvVaw3tzQAGidFvfKtcatY5g4x8">Certification of Richard Allen&rsquo;s Attorneys</a></span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on January 27, 2024.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Andrew Baldwin files a </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nvbddhFrKh87rI0MFck0_Z0fc868JkaA/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787246975&amp;usg=AOvVaw2dyV1E0r5GUuJVXrY7-gjA">Verified Motion to Disqualify</a></span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on January 28, 2024.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Nick McLeland files the </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e4zfc7PunzAVNIF08qnS1WJYgZRqGSOk/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787247395&amp;usg=AOvVaw1wSUUL8z_-YdTOPTMMkPVq">State&rsquo;s Response to Defense&rsquo;s Motion for Transfer</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HZjcRphPqkdXEwi160uncLP2qDN-FG9n&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787247664&amp;usg=AOvVaw1tGp0u3EBBpbLe4Z6EKgKC">Exhibits</a></span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on January 29, 2024.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Nick McLeland files </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pegewZbOkt3LM7Lnvkrc2chQ_nYgws4B/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787248060&amp;usg=AOvVaw14inLQuU3qDNmBWuy3TX0v">Verified Information of Contemptuous Conduct</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YO5eZtH-jfGzZm6P8b3ZokP9HbeWLB-x&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787248261&amp;usg=AOvVaw2_bqG_9JUDxSZpHEMoATY8">Exhibit</a></span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on January 29, 2024.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Judge Gull enters an </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b8B10PJPugeiVj80sbt7xq6YcQc1Y5eM/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787248547&amp;usg=AOvVaw2gkntE5_J9vo053VOJPbdF">Order</a></span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on January 29, 2024.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">COME NOW William S.

The final paragraph of the Order states, &quot;Any violation of this Order and any conduct the Court finds disruptive of the proceedings is punishable as direct contempt of Court and will result in a term of imprisonment and permanent exclusion from the Courtroom, the Courthouse, and all future proceedings.&quot; Paragraph 5 of the Order states, in part, &quot;members of the public are ordered to conduct themselves in such a fashion as to limit disruption to the offices, personnel, and patrons of those offices.&quot; The Court recessed the morning hearing at approximately noon. The Court observed a member of the gallery, later identified as Richard Snay, becoming animated and somewhat vocal with Courtroom Security, who admonished him to sit down. At approximately 12:10 pm. Court Security observed Snay and David Noe engaged in conversation on the first floor, that ultimately became heated. Court Security advised them to be civil and leave the building. Court Security removed both participants from the building and observed a verbal altercation between them on the sidewalk and surrounding areas of the Courthouse. The Court finds the conduct of Richard Snay and David Noe to be in direct violation of Paragraph 5 of the Decorum Order, and therefore, permanently excludes Richard Snay and David Noe from all future proceedings in this cause.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Stacey Diener files an </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f5JjJRrup7LKWgmIJUZFJgsLHFB7okis/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787273504&amp;usg=AOvVaw24TmGsUTOc4j543PqW_LRo">Appearance</a></span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on March 21, 2024.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Judge Gull enters an </span><span class="c5">Order</span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on March 21, 2024.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Ex parte communication from Frank Wesseling, dated March 16, 2024, ordered copied and sent to counsel of record and the Clerk of Carroll Circuit Court.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Judge Gull enters an </span><span class="c5">Order</span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on March 21, 2024.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Court orders the ex parte communication from Frank Wesseling, dated March 19, 2024, copied and sent to counsel and the Clerk of Carroll Circuit Court.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Judge Gull enters an </span><span class="c5">Order</span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on March 21, 2024.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Court has received Request for Recording of Court Proceedings by News Media from Corryn Brock, WPTA, and Jeff Wiehe, WANE 15, for trial May 13-31, 2024, and denies same.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Judge Gull enters and </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wxUd-vDDavTx2iBUoS835kpYl8sG4sbb/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787274478&amp;usg=AOvVaw3QpC9sW06fa-CKMFNJ0SqX">Order</a></span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on March 22, 2024.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Defendant appears in person and with counsel, Attorneys Bradley Rozzi and Andrew Baldwin.

The recordings of interviews between February 14-20, 2017 were lost due to human error or were spontaneously lost due to the equipment resetting. At the time the interview of Brad Holder was lost, he was not a key suspect in the case. The interview was memorialized in a written report provided to the defendant. Patrick Westfall was interviewed at his home by FBI agents. That interview was not recorded but was documented in a written report provided to the defendant. Patrick Westfall was not a key suspect in the case at the time of the interview. As neither Holder nor Westfall were suspects at the time the interviews were conducted, the defendant has failed to show that the lost interview of Holder was material and that the lack of a recorded interview of Westfall was material. As defendant must establish materiality to claim a denial of due process and Allen had failed to do so, his due process rights have not been violated.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Nick McLeland files the </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g6iwpvguqJR1lC2PxiPiUcxuGHpHPkMi/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787281574&amp;usg=AOvVaw0JE7kQpwYv0KxLvzEW1VWr">State&rsquo;s Response to Third Motion for Franks Hearing</a></span><span class="c4 c3">;

dated on April 30, 2024.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">The Court, having had this matter under advisement following a hearing conducted on March 18, 2024, and having reviewed the evidence admitted at the hearing (the Court did not review any evidence that was offered but not admitted), the arguments of counsel and the briefs and memorandums submitted by Counsel now finds that the State proved by a preponderance of the evidence that defense counsel was sloppy, negligent, and incompetent in their handling of discovery materials. Counsel failed to properly secure evidence and discovery material in this matter. Counsel negligently allowed their discovery outline to be sent to an individual unrelated to this matter (Brandon Woodhouse) who then disseminated that information to the public. Counsel further allowed their discovery materials to be compromised by Westerman (who, in turn, provided the information to Fortson and Cohen). Counsel has described Westerman both as a criminal and a valued consultant and confidante. Despite this Court&#39;s findings of sloppiness, negligence, and incompetence, the State is required to prove that Counsels&#39; conduct was willful and intentional beyond a reasonable doubt for the Court to find Counsel in contempt. As the State has not met that burden, the Court declines to find them in contempt of Court for violating the Protective Order issued February 17, 2023, regarding discovery. The State has also alleged that defense counsel violated the &quot;gag order&quot; issued by the Court on December 2, 2022. Defense counsel issued a Press Release on December 1, 2022. The release contained statements that are potentially violative of the Rules of Professional Conduct. As Defense Counsels&#39; Counsel correctly argues in his post-hearing brief, the gag order was not yet issued. As such, the Court declines to find Counsel in contempt of Court as no Order was in place. To the extent that the Press Release violated the Rules of Professional Responsibility, the Trial Court has no jurisdiction to enforce those Rules. As required by the Rules of Professional Responsibility, the Trial Court will, therefore, send a copy of this Order and the Press Release to the Office of judicial and Attorney Regulation, Executive Director Adrienne Meiring for that Office to enforce the Rules or determine Counsels&#39; ethical misconduct.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c10 c5"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a29u7wRx9WIVy6dZMa0aJvGpPt1nMns2&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787295048&amp;usg=AOvVaw1c1yj6N1P0GfWTBFiXrr86">MAY 2024</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">The State and Defense file a </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1joVbRw2mlD_CVs7yQmQx9mSv76dC7Wk7/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787295541&amp;usg=AOvVaw2mMqiJw5XXxiVlROQBecYm">Motion to Enter Stipulated Protective Order</a></span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on May 1, 2024.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Judge Gull enters an </span><span class="c5">Order</span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on May 1, 2024.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Amended order reflecting May 7, 2024 hearing date.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Judge Gull enters a </span><span class="c5">Transport Order;</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;dated on May 1, 2024.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Judge Gull enters an </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QzU3ZR3vWBEdeLaH0WXd8nsXXZYODQtm/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787296602&amp;usg=AOvVaw1WqplhtVmfEBh34w9d3RVO">Order</a></span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on May 2, 2024.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Comes now the Court, having reviewed the Motion for Stipulated Protective Order signed by counsel for non-party Indiana Department of Correction and Defendant Richard M.

As defendant is not prepared to address his Motion to Suppress filed April 15, 2024, and the State&#39;s Motion for Admissibility, those matters are continued and will be reset at the conclusion of the hearings May 21-23, 2024.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">Hearing Scheduling Activity</span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on May 17, 2024.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Hearing scheduled for 05/22/2024 at 10:00 am.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Andrew Baldwin files </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KtRqwsvrVRrHcyOILJvR4Es8yfnj6qSi/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787306543&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Y9H2GeBi0sIQLnNDRlmld">Defendant&rsquo;s Second Motion to Dismiss Based Upon Newly Discovered Destroyed Exculpatory or Potentially Useful Evidence</a></span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on May 20, 2024.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Andrew Baldwin and Brad Rozzi file a </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JeKs5Vo4_rEW5Z-faHsqAzk6uDNA4_Xw/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787306847&amp;usg=AOvVaw1mTvtMTF1mVBE1HIihnagu">Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendant&#39;s Second Motion to Dismiss</a></span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on May 20, 2024.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Nick McLeland files the State&rsquo;s </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1natAtLuibVNNmCjM8ZQIW7rmVoQl-qLO/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787307207&amp;usg=AOvVaw0yfKHEX7G9ux5qWXrPvYLQ">Objection to Defendant&rsquo;s Motion to Continue</a></span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on May 20, 2024.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Andrew Baldwin files </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s4qrH1-WRzE-ImaMOEKOn2mZ-djdEBuD/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787307506&amp;usg=AOvVaw3_f45y5e57eBWVoe8koq70">Defendant&rsquo;s Reply to State&rsquo;s Objection to Defendant&rsquo;s Motion to Continue</a></span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on May 20, 2024.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Judge Gull enters an </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GCVu3NSZVig3-toMWJjfTEtc4DrpHOBY/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787307894&amp;usg=AOvVaw1a5D2cxm4VrMMogMe9IN4k">Order</a></span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on May 20, 2024.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">The Court has reviewed the Defense Second Verified Motion to Disqualify Judge and Request for Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Upon Denial of this Request, If the Court Denies this Request, filed Friday, May 17, 2024, at 3:04 p.m. As the Court is now required to review and rule upon the forty-two page pleading, the Court is compelled to cancel the pretrial hearing previously set with counsels&#39; agreement.

As Trial Rule 52 is not applicable in criminal cases, the defendant&#39;s request for Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law is denied. Neely v. State, 297 N.E.2d 847 (Ind. App. 1973); Davis v. State, 642 N.E.2d 987 (Ind. App. 1994). The Court, however, will address each of defendant&#39;s allegations in this Order. Defendant claims the Court directed the Carroll County Sheriff to ignore a subpoena. The Court directed an e-mail to counsel on June 14, 2023, regarding the witness refusing to cooperate with the service of the subpoena and demonstrating a willingness to fight the Deputy attempting service. The Court requested a report of the witness&#39; refusal to cooperate and be transported for the scheduled hearing and forwarded that report to counsel when it was received. The decision by the Deputy to leave without the witness was his and was not directed by the Court. Defendant claims the Court engaged in ex parte communication with the Carroll County Sheriff regarding defendant&#39;s housing, transportation, and safety during jury selection and trial May 13-31, 2024. These communications were administrative in nature and did not address any substantive issues. The communications were directed to where the defendant would be housed during the trial and who would be conducting transportation. The Court did notify counsel where defendant would be housed during the trial (as he is still under the safekeeping order) in an e-mail, but did not inform counsel of the communication, as nothing substantively was discussed. The Court has set the defendant&#39;s Motion to Vacate Safekeeping Order for hearing, but was required to cancel the hearing upon the filing of this pending Second Verified Motion to Disqualify. Counsel claim the Court invited the State to limit defendant&#39;s Sixth Amendment right to present a defense. The Court has always required counsel in all criminal cases to follow the law relating to third-party perpetrators. The Court reminded counsel of their obligation to follow the law in the Court&#39;s e-mail of April 28, 2024. Counsel claim the Court has disparaged them and ruled on defense pleadings without hearings. The Court&#39;s comments about counsels&#39; performance were documented in the Court&#39;s Order of April 30, 2024, regarding their handling of discovery materials. If pleadings on their face are not supported by the law or admissible evidence, judicial economy does not require a hearing. Allegations the Court has treated the Prosecution more favorably than the defense are unsupported by any admissible evidence provided by the defense at the March 18, 2024, hearing. The Court was notified on May 20, 2024, of an inquiry by the Indiana State Police to the Court Reporter via e-mail on May 9, 2024, regarding ex parte communication received by the Court from Gary Beaudette (which was previously provided to all counsel). The Court is unaware of the extent of any Indiana State Police investigation. Defendant blames the Court for ex parte pleadings which were inadvertently directed to the Prosecutor. The defense staff filed pleadings and marked them as &quot;confidential&quot;, apparently unaware that the &quot;confidential&quot; marking makes them available to the State, but not the public. Counsels&#39; staff contacted this Court&#39;s staff and were advised that the Statewide Odyssey Case Management System (not DoxPop as alleged in the pleading) has a distinct process for filing pleadings &quot;ex parte&quot; as opposed to &quot;confidential&quot;. The Court did e-mail defense counsel a tutorial paper authored by JTAC explaining the process. Since that communication, defense counsel have had no issues with their staff properly filing ex parte pleadings. Accusations of violating Rules on Access to Court Records have been completely explained and dealt with, including by the Indiana Supreme Court in the first Writ of Mandamus filed by defendant. Counsel claim their Motions are treated differently than those Motions filed by the State. The Court has set hearings on pending Motions which have now been continued due to the filing of this Motion to Disqualify. When defendant files pleadings, the State is entitled to file a response. The Court follows Trial Rule 6 regarding time and gives the State twenty (20) days to respond. Defendant is also given twenty (20) days to reply to the State&#39;s responses. Once the issues are closed, if a hearing is required, one will be set. Defendant asserts that the Court ignored his request to set aside two weeks for the defense case while refusing to set time limits on the Prosecution. On March 6, 2024, defendant filed a Motion for Speedy Trial. The Court granted that Motion on March 7, 2024, and set the case for speedy trial May 13-31, 2024. On April 30, 2024, defendant filed a Motion for a Pre-Trial Hearing, which the Court set for hearing on May 7, 2024. At no time prior to the May 7, 2024, hearing did defendant advise the Court that three (3) weeks for trial was inadequate. At no time prior to May 7, 2024, did defendant indicate a belief that three (3) additional weeks could be added to the trial without notice to the Court, witnesses, and more importantly, without notice to the potential jurors. While the Court agrees a continuance of the trial is harmful to the defendant and the State, it could have been avoided had counsel communicated prior to May 7, 2024. Counsel represent they notified the Court on or about October 4, 2023, that they would need two (2) weeks to present a defense, but the Court has no record of that communication, nor any recall of such communication. Counsels&#39; assertion that &quot;Between all defense counsel with a combined seventy (70) years of experience not one time have they been told that a trial would absolutely end on a certain day and not go any longer&quot; is irrational and unreasonable. The Court is aware its colleagues across the state routinely give trial dates that begin on a set date and end on a set date. The Court is not required to guarantee equal time for both the defendant and the State. The Court is required to guarantee sufficient time on the calendar and sufficient notice to jurors and the parties to present their case, however long it takes. Had Counsel notified the Court within days of receiving the March 7, 2024, Court Order setting the case for speedy trial May 13-31, 2024, that the time allotted on the calendar was insufficient, the Court would have immediately rectified the situation and extended the trial to May 13 - June 14, 2024. Trial is now set for October 14 - November 15, 2024, as requested by the defendant. Counsel accuse the Court of engaging in extrajudicial activity. Counsel is correct that on July 9, 2023, the Court commented on a Facebook post about a softball tournament her granddaughter participated in in Delphi. The Court did not attend the tournament, but did say &quot;Congratulations&quot; to her former daughter-in-law&#39;s post about their team winning the tournament. If Counsels&#39; allegations in this part of their Motion are well-founded (regarding a potential witness&#39; alleged social media activities) and are presented to the Court for ruling, the Court will rule accordingly. Concerns about anticipatory rulings are not reasonable. Defendant asserts the Court has denied reasonable requests for funding. This is incorrect. Counsel is well aware of the amount of funds the Court has authorized for the defendant. The Court has requested the defendant to submit proper invoices and bills for Carroll County taxpayer funding. Invoices which have been submitted without appropriate documentation have been returned. The bill counsel refers to for $26,000 for investigative services from June 4, 2023, through October 16, 2023, was, in fact, returned to counsel as no documentation was provided for services. No documentation was submitted until quite recently. With that proper support and documentation, the Court authorized that invoice for payment on May 17, 2024. Defendant complains that public confidence in this case has eroded. As counsel should know, criminal cases are tried in a Court of law, not in the court of public opinion. An independent judiciary requires that judges decide cases according to the law and facts without regard to public clamor or fear of criticism. The Court continues to receive ex parte communications from the public criticizing the Court both personally and professionally, and threatening the Court with bodily harm and injury. The Court continues to provide these communications to the parties. The Court is not interested in &quot;memes and other social media content that can be easily located on the internet&quot; (Paragraph 129 of defendant&#39;s Second Verified Motion to Disqualify). The Court cannot be swayed by inappropriate and ridiculous outside influences. Defendant further claims the Court has refused to order the State to comply with discovery rules. The Court has set defendant&#39;s Motion to Compel and Motion for Sanctions for hearing, which has been continued due to the filing of this Motion to Disqualify. The previous defense Motion to Compel was denied without hearing as it was unsupported by evidence. Defense counsel allege bias by the Court only allowing cameras in the Courtroom on one occasion. The Court has not allowed cameras in the Carroll Circuit Court due to its limited size and layout. The Court did allow cameras in the Allen Superior Court at the hearing conducted on October 19, 2023. The hearing was not conducted, and the media outlet providing pool coverage did not comply with the Court&#39;s directives regarding coverage and broadcasting of the proceedings. The Court lost confidence in the ability of the media to cover hearings appropriately. The Court has issued adverse rulings against the defendant, as well as against the State of Indiana. Adverse rulings do not support a reasonable basis for questioning the Court&#39;s impartiality, nor are they grounds for disqualification, they are just adverse rulings. Defendant&#39;s Second Verified Motion to Disqualify Judge And Request For Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law Upon Denial Of This Request, If This Court Denies This Request is denied.</span></p><hr><p class="c8"><span class="c10 c5"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a52puIUE2CPTc9l3MIWu_tOf6peubahy&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787310443&amp;usg=AOvVaw0E9k9_MsWiJ2L2O8WX720p">JUNE 2024</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c19 c5"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Nick McLeland files the </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WSjLW1cEpJa9EeLDXIBrJaAVto-5qZhp/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787310794&amp;usg=AOvVaw3hPPPJ4wtFm4XuWHC3ret6">State&#39;s Response To Defendant&rsquo;s Second Motion to Dismiss Based Upon Newly Discovered Destroyed And/Or Missing Exculpatory Or Potentially Useful Evidence</a></span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on June 9, 2024.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Andrew Baldwin, Brad Rozzi, and Jennifer Auger file </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vBImO3iEuUMSw-kXhGCIdHUrYvyf8Qj1/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787311104&amp;usg=AOvVaw2GU3IGEewwkIUv4i-KXIgv">Accused&rsquo;s Response to This Court&rsquo;s May 31, 2024 &ldquo;Order or Judgement of the Court&rdquo; and Notice of Conflict</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1c2vPEraDWJuSc4UoPiCYYbNxBweBxD2q&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787311306&amp;usg=AOvVaw3baeFzs9wdf9NoimpMCQAw">Exhibits</a></span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on June 18, 2024.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Judge Gull enters an </span><span class="c5">Order</span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on June 21, 2024.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Court orders Defendant&#39;s Motion to Suppress (filed April 15, 2024), State&#39;s Motion for Admissibility (filed May 6, 2024), defense Motion to Suppress Second Statement (filed April 15, 2024), State&#39;s Objection to Defendant&#39;s Motion to Suppress (filed April 15, 2024), defendant&#39;s Motion to Compel and Motion for Sanctions (filed April 23, 2024), defendant&#39;s Motion to Vacate Safekeeping Order (filed May 13, 2024), State&#39;s Motion in Limine (filed April 28, 2024) the defense Response to State&#39;s Motion in Limine, Defendant&#39;s Second Motion to Dismiss (filed May 20, 2024), and the State&#39;s Response to Defendant&#39;s Second Motion to Dismiss (filed June 9, 2024) all set for hearing by agreement of counsel on July 30 - August 1, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in the Carroll Circuit Court.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c5">Hearing Scheduling Activity</span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on June 24, 2024.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Miscellaneous Motions scheduled for 07/30/2024 at 10:00 am.

No evidence has been presented to the Court that the State destroyed exculpatory evidence nor that the State acted in bad faith. The defense argues that this alleged exculpatory evidence all relates to one person, Brad Holder. However, no evidence has been presented to support this argument, nor has any evidence been presented to negate the evidence offered by the State which cleared Brad Holder of involvement in these crimes. Defendant&#39;s Second Motion to Dismiss is therefore denied as unsupported by the law and the evidence.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Judge Gull enters an </span><span class="c5">Order</span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on August 15, 2024.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">The Court, having taken defendant&#39;s Motion to Compel and Motion for Sanctions under advisement following a hearing conducted July 30, 2024, and having reviewed the submitted exhibits and arguments of counsel, now denies the defendant&#39;s Motion to Compel and Motion for Sanctions as the defendant has failed to comply with Trial Rule 26(F) in seeking an informal resolution of discovery disputes; however, the Court will order the State to turn over Sergeant Cecil&#39;s report within ten (10) days of date of this order and that any new discovery be provided within seven (7) days of receipt.

dated on August 29, 2024.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">The Court, having had this matter under advisement following a hearing conducted on July 31, 2024, on the Defendant&#39;s Motion to Suppress Statements (filed April 11, 2024), the State&#39;s Objection to Defendant&#39;s Motion to Suppress Filed April 11, 2024 (filed April 23, 2024), the State&#39;s Motion to Dismiss the Motion to Suppress Filed April 11, 2024 (filed May 17, 2024), and the State&#39;s Motion for Admissibility (filed May 6, 2024), and having considered the witnesses&#39; testimony, the exhibits admitted into evidence, the arguments of counsel, and the applicable statutes and case law, now grants the State&#39;s Request for Pre-Trial Ruling on Admissibility pursuant to I.C. 25-33-1-17. The statements given by defendant to Dr. Monica H. Wala, Psy.D., are not privileged based upon the exception noted in the Statute, &quot;(1) Trials for homicide when the disclosure relates directly to the fact or immediate circumstances of said homicide.&quot; All statements given by defendant to Dr. Wala are admissible in the trial. Defendant&#39;s arguments to the contrary go to the weight the jury would give such statements, not their admissibility. Having taken the State&#39;s Motion to Dismiss the Motion to Suppress Filed April 11, 2024 under advisement at the hearing, the Court agrees with the State that the defendant has failed to comply with the Criminal Rules of Procedure by neglecting to clearly state which specific statements he is seeking to suppress, nor the legal basis for the suppression. Despite these deficiencies, the Court has been able to determine that the statements given to the defendant&#39;s family members were voluntary, not coerced by any State action, and were not made under threats of violence, or improper influence. Although the Defendant is clearly in custody, he initiated the communication with his family and was not subject to custodial interrogation when he spoke to this family. Further, the statements given by defendant to the correctional officers, inmate companions, the Warden, mental health personnel, medical personnel, and the Indiana State Police were unsolicited by any of those individuals and were voluntarily given without coercion or interrogation. The defendant has not shown that he suffered from psychological coercion by the State which caused him to make these statements. To the contrary, the evidence shows he specifically sought out the Warden by written communication he initiated, and verbal statements he offered to guards, inmate companions, mental health professionals, and medical personnel. The defendant has failed to show any of these statements were the result of coercive interrogation by the State, or that they were the result of his pre-trial detention. The totality of the circumstances of defendant&#39;s pre-trial detention were not intended to force confessions from the defendant. The defendant&#39;s pre-trial detention is to protect him from harm. The Court is not persuaded that the detention caused the defendant to make incriminating statements. While the defendant does suffer from major depressive disorder and anxiety, those are not serious mental illnesses that prevent the defendant from making voluntary statements. The Court finds the statements given by the defendant to Dr. Wala, the Warden, inmates, guards, medical personnel, mental health professionals, and law enforcement personnel were not coerced, were voluntary, were not the result of interrogation by the State or its actors, nor the product of his confinement and, therefore, denies the defendant&#39;s Motion to Suppress Statements filed April 11, 2024.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Judge Gull enters an </span><span class="c5">Order</span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on August 30, 2024.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Order granting Motion for Order to Shorten Discovery Response Period.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Judge Gull enters an </span><span class="c5">Order</span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on August 30, 2024.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Order granting Second Motion for Order to Shorten Discovery Response Period.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c10 c5"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1or3usnmLPb8V77y5HcWoOl4WTCkG1S8b&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787330485&amp;usg=AOvVaw1h7gS40AT8BKwhJC_W4gco">SEPTEMBER 2024</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c19 c5"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Judge Gull enters an </span><span class="c2"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hb6uZzuRsrXqb9OuSZNt_Rd6aMkdDfDh/view?usp%3Ddrivesdk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1727333787330785&amp;usg=AOvVaw1413fQFZIl1s02HspFoguo">Order</a></span><span class="c4 c3">; dated on September 3, 2024.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">The Court, having had the State&#39;s Motion in Limine under advisement following a hearing conducted on August 1, 2024, and having heard and considered the evidence, admitted exhibits, arguments of counsel, Defendant&#39;s Supplemental Submission Regarding State&#39;s Motion in Limine (filed August 13, 2024), and the State&#39;s Response to Defendant&#39;s Memorandum of Law (filed August 26, 2024), grants paragraphs 1 through 6, over defendant&#39;s objection, and grants paragraphs 8 through 12 over defendant&#39;s objection. As it relates to paragraph 7, the burden is on the defendant to show a nexus between Odinism, cult or ritualistic killing, Brad Holder, Patrick Westfall, Johnny Messer, Elvis Fields, Ned Smith, Rod Abrahms, Kegan Kline, Jerry Kline, Ron Logan and the murders of the two victims. The case law is quite clear that the nexus must not be based on speculation, conjecture, rumors, or hearsay, but rather on admissible evidence. The Court finds the defense has failed to produce admissible evidence demonstrating a nexus between Odinism, cult or ritualistic killing, Brad Holder, Patrick Westfall, Johnny Messer, Elvis Fields, Ned Smith, Rod Abrahms, Kegan Kline, Jerry Kline, Ron Logan and the murders. Therefore, the Court grants paragraph 7 of the State&#39;s Motion in Limine over defendant&#39;s objection. The Court will not permit the evidence submitted by the defense in support of their arguments regarding third-party perpetrators in the trial of this cause as the probative value of such evidence is greatly outweighed by confusion of the issues and its potential to mislead the jury. The Court will allow that evidence to support an offer of proof at the trial if one is made by Counsel. Jury selection will commence in Allen Superior Court October 14, 2024, with trial commencing in the Carroll Circuit Court, concluding November 15, 2024.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c5">Hearing on September 4, 2024.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Closed Status Hearing.</span></p><hr><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c5"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c3">Judge Gull enters an </span><span class="c5">Order</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;on September 4, 2024.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Defendant appears with Attorneys Bradley Rozzi and Jennifer Auger.
